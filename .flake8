# IMPORTANT: avoid using ignore option, always use extend-ignore instead
# Completely and unconditionally ignore the following errors:
extend-ignore =
  E203,  # annoy black by allowing white space before : https://github.com/psf/black/issues/315
  E402,  # ansible requires import after doc strings
  E501,  # given the ansible_collections this is nearly impossible

# Accessibility/large fonts and PEP8 unfriendly:
max-line-length = 100

# Count the number of occurrences of each error/warning code and print a report:
