[![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ansible-collections/ansible.utils)](https://codecov.io/gh/ansible-collections/ansible.utils)

The Ansible ``ansible.utils`` collection includes a variety of plugins that aid in the management, manupulation and visibility of data for the Ansible playbook developer.

<!--start requires_ansible-->
## Ansible version compatibility

This collection has been tested against following Ansible versions: **>=2.9.10,<2.11**.

Plugins and modules within a collection may be tested with only specific Ansible versions.
A collection may contain metadata that identifies these versions.
PEP440 is the schema used to describe the versions of Ansible.

## Using this collection

The most common use case for this collection is when complex data structures are present in an Ansible playbook, inventory, or returned from modules are worked with.

## Contributing to this collection

This collection is intended for plugins that are not platform or discipline specific. Simple plugin examples should be generic in nature, more complex examples can include real world platform module to demonstrate the utility of the plugin in a playbook.

We welcome community contributions to this collection.

### Developer notes

- 100% code coverage is the goal, although it's not always possible. Please include unit and integration tests with all PRs. PRs should not cause a decrease in code coverage.
- filter plugins should be 1 per file, with an included DOCUMENTATION string/or reference a lookup plugin with the same name.
- action, filter and lookup plugins should use argspec validation, see AnsibleArgSpecValidator
- This collection should not depend on other collections for imported code
- Use of the latest version of black is required for formatting (black -l79)
- The README contains a table of plugins, the collection_prep utilities make this easy to maintain
