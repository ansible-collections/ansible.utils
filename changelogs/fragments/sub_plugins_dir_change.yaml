breaking_changes:
  - Move sub plugins cli_parsers, fact_diff and validate to `plugins/sub_plugins` folder
  - If added custom sub plugins in your collection move from old location `plugins/<sub-plugin-name>` to the
    new location `plugins/sub_plugins/<sub-plugin-name>` and update the imports as required
  - The `cli_parsers` sub plugins folder name is changed to `cli_parse` to have consistent naming convention,
    that is all the cli_parse subplugins will now be in `plugins/sub_plugins/cli_parse` folder
