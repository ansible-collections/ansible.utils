    ipsubnet - interacting with large subnets could cause performance
    constraints. the result would be the system would appear to hang while
    it built out a list of all possible subnets or stepped through all
    possible subnets one at a time. when sending a prefix that is a supernet
    of the passed in network the behavior wasn't consistent. this now returns
    an AnsibleFilterError in that scenario across all python releases.
