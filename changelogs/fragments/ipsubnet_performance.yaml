bugfixes:
  - >-
    ipsubnet - interacting with large subnets could cause performance
    constraints. the result would be the system would appear to hang while
    it built out a list of all possible subnets or stepped through all
    possible subnets one at a time. when sending a prefix that is a supernet
    of the passed in network the behavior wasn't consistent. this now returns
    an AnsibleFilterError in that scenario across all python releases.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.utils/issues/132)
minor_changes:
  - >-
    ipsubnet - the index parameter should only ever be an integer if it is
    provided. this changes the argument type from str to int.
